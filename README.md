# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview
  The purpose of this analysis was to first create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by each city type: "Urban", "Suburban" and "Rural". I was then asked to create a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type. 


## Results
  For Deliverable one, I was instructed to to use the starter code given to get the total number of rides, drivers, and fares for each city type. Then I was requested to find the average fare per driver for each city type and create a new DataFrame with this infomration. For Deliverable 1, the rural city type had a vastly smaller amount of rides compared to the suburban and urban types. The rural type has 125 rides while suburban had 625 and urban had 1625 total rides. Despite this, the rural type has the most expensive trip costs as well as the highest average fare per driver. The suburban and urban fares per ride were $24.53 and $30.97 respectively while the rural fares were $34.62. This can also be said for the driver count as well as the average fare per driver. There were only 78 rural type drivers while the average fare was $55.49. Suburban and Urban had cheapter fares with $30.97 and $24.53 per ride as well as $39.50 and $16.57 average fare per driver.

In Deliverable two, I created a DataFrame for the summary of the fares for each city type and then plotted the data on a multiple-line showing how much the sum of the fares would change over the span of a couple of months. According to Deliverable two, the rural had the least expesive fares each week while the urban had the most expensive fares. The rural fare went as low as $67.65 on 01-13-2019 while the urban fare went as high as $2,466.29 on 02-24-2019. The suburban city type, just like in Deliverable one, sat in the middle of the two ranges having fares that were more expensive than the rural city type but it never reached the expenses of the urban cityt type. This can also be seen in the graph where the red suburban line stayed in the middle of the two other types with no intersections at any point.
